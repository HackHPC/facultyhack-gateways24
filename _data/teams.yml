    <ul>
      <li> This course is meant to students but also to faculty/staff beyond typical course environments (CSCI 5306) </li>
      <li> The main goal is to create a course that can be flexible in the time/duration from 1 to 16 weeks (1. Adding more training and modules, and 2: Produce customized modules to the different disciplines). </li>
      <li> The course will consist of lectures, practical hands-on homework assignments, and hands-on laboratory work where students will try to build their own scripts to be executed in the HPC environment. </li>

  projectgoals: >
    To add a module to an undergraduate Intro to Data Science course that demonstrates how to use Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud, with a large dataset, and if I can, GPUs to train an ML model that would not be possible to do without a GPU-enabled device. Outcomes would be an understanding of accessing cloud interfaces, basic terminal commands, an overview of the Jupyter notebook as both a local and cloud tool, and if possible, how to test if GPUs are being seen. Update: possibly using JetStream2.
